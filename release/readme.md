# How to use BRA?

Log into your blogger account and go to the blog you want to use with BRA (you can create one or use an existing one), go to the THEME menu and in the dropdown, use RESTORE, importing the template you have here in RELEASE.

Once done, go to design and configure your preferences, both in colours with the BRA1-VARS widget and the others.
